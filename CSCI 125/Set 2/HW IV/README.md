# Homework Task

Create a program with a class named `SodaCan` that contains a constructor that takes the `height` and `diameter` of the soda can as parameters. Also, create methods `getVolume()` and `getSurfaceArea()`. 

In my code I used `Math.PI` in the formulas and also implemented `DecimalFormat` from the `java.text` package that helped me format the calculations so that I could return shorter values. In addition, when passing the `diameter` parameter you must divide it by 2 so that you have the radius instead of the diameter.
