# Homework Task

Write a program that replaces all *l* with ! and all *s* with $. There is a `replace()` method that is used for `String` that takes two `char` parameters and replaces them within the `String`.

In my case, I am not sure why I decided to use a for loop when I did the assignment since the `replace` essentially completes this function, I adjusted the code to have a static method that can be used to demonstrate both approaches.
