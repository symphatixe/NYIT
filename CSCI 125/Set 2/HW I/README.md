# Homework Task

Create a simple `CashRegister` class that stores a balance for some purchase and then takes a payment, after taking the payment it returns the change. Afterwards enchance this class by adding methods: `enterDollars`, `enterQuarters`, `enterDimes`, `enterNickels`, and `enterPennies`. These methods will allow a user to enter a specific amount of either dollars and coins.  

In my program, the methods are renamed to say `payDollars()` and so on, the payment is stored in a `double` data type, meaning you can enter some dollar amount such as *$125.30*.
