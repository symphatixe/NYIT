# Homework Task

Implement a class `SodaCan` that has methods `getSurfaceArea()` and `getVolume()`. The constructor should take height and radius parameters for the can,  also take into consideration, a soda can is a cylinder.

This code also uses `DecimalFormat` from the `java.text` package that helped me format the calculations so that I could return shorter values.
