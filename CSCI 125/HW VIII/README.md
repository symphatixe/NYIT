# Homework Task

Create a class `SavingsAccount` that is similar to the `BankAccount` class that was created in HW IV, except adding an instance variable for interest. The constructor must accept two parameters: initial balance and interest rate. There should also be a method `addInterest()` that adds interest to the account at using some predetermined incrementation. The program should create a `SavingsAccount` object that has an initial balance of $1000 and an initial interest of 10%. Use the `addInterest()` method five times and print the resulting balance.

In my case, `addInterest()` incremented by a whole number of 1, meaning the ending interest rate would become 15%.
