# Homework Task

Write a unit conversion program that asks users to identify what unit they want to convert froma and what unit they want to convert to, Lastly, a value is entered to convert and the conversion is printed out. The units used are inches, feet, miles, millimeters, centimeters, and kilometers. 

In my code I used an ArrayList to store the values in String form and the two values are read as int values. The program asks the user to input the values as numbers that are then matched to do the conversions. 


In retrospect I should have received the values as Strings and then just stored the conversion value in a `final int` value to remove redundant code.
