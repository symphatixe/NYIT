# Programming I Homeworks

These homeworks are simple programming practice, I was doing them when I was on my summer break freshman year because I was bored, and since I started I plan on completing them.

Each homework will have a short README file to indicate the task.

(Also small note here, I know some of the programs may not follow common programming paradigms by capitalizing the class name and other common practices. I have learned to use them now :) )
