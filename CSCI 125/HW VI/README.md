# Homework Task

Implement a class `Circle` that has the methods `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()`, the constructor should take a radius parameter.

In my code I used `Math.PI` in the formulas and also implemented `DecimalFormat` from the `java.text` package that helped me format the calculations so that I could return shorter values.
