# Homework Task

Enhance the `BankAccount` class and some of the features to reject negative amounts in the deposit and withdraw methods. In addition, reject withdrawals that would result in a negative balance. 

The code was very simple since I used my old code from before and checked the parameters to make sure they were not negative. In the withdraw method I checked to make sure the paremeter was smaller than the balance stored on the account and only then let the withdrawal go through.
