# Homework Task

Write a program that translates a number between 0 and 4 into a letter grade. THe number 2.8 would be converted into a 2.8 GPA. Ties should be in favor of a better grade, for example 2.85 would be a B instead of a B-. Create a class `Grade` and a method `getLetterGrade()`.

In my code I manually used if and else if statements to portion out the grades to return an accurate representation of the letter grade according to the GPA. I decided that anything lower than a 1.2 would be labeled as a letter grade of `F`.
